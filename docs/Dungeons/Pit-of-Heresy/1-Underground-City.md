## Notes

### Team Setup

There's not much of a team specific setup here really. Everyone is either on their own or grouped up together, dealer's choice.

> [!sherpa] Sherpa Notes  
> If you're guiding New Lights through this for the first time, it's probably best to all group up so you can teach them the symbol callouts and how the relic sword works.

### Details

Take a moment to scan the area to see what's around. Guardians don't have to memorize the landscape, but getting a feel for where the bridges and elevators are, where the buildings are, etc can help with navigating things.

### Loadouts

Decent add clear and a good special weapon for the **Accursed Knights** and **Blistering Ogres**.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors

Ah yes, the Scarlet Keep. An old but familiar location from Shadowkeep. This time we're heading straight for the back of the room where there's a crystal and a Hive forcefield blocking a hole that will open up momentarily.

When your fireteam drops down, you'll navigate through some creepy dark tunnels until you find yourselves by a rally point and a vast cavern with a Hive city built into it.

The first thing to do is locate to one of the buildings with a symbol above it and peak inside the door. There's going to be an **Accursed Knight** there just hanging out and minding his business. Murderize him and take his sword.

Above him you'll notice three seals bound in chains. Breaking these is the main goal here.

How do we do that? Well you just have to match the symbols found here to the buildings throughout the cavern.

For example, if you have **Burger**, **Ice Cream**, and **A**, you'll locate the buildings with those symbols above them.

—

It doesn't really matter which order you do these in, but let's just start from the first building in our example, **Burger**.

When you get to **Burger**, you'll notice that the entrance is walled off by a Hive forcefield. Damn. Opening the door is easy though, just kill all of the adds around the area and bam, it's open.

Inside you'll find either a **Knight**, **Wizard**, or **Shrieker**. Each one of them can only be killed by the relic sword in a specific manner. I mentioned what to do in the [intro](./index.md), but I'll repeat it here for ease of access:

=== "Knight"  
	Use the light attack of the sword to murderize it.

=== "Wizard"  
	Use the heavy attack to shoot waves of energy at it.

=== "Shrieker"  
	Use the guard to reflect its blasts back at it. Fun fact, you can also reflect the blasts from ogres with this.

> [!careful] What Do You Mean Immune?!  
> It bears reiterating that the only way to kill these particular enemies is to use the relic sword dropped by an **Accursed Knight**. Any other weapon or ability will not do a damn thing.  
> The relic sword has a limited number of uses as well. Pay attention to the ammo! If you need another sword, go to one of the bridges close by and wait for another **Accursed Knight** to spawn.

Fantastic! It's dead! Huzzah! After you kill it, notice that one of the three seals has disappeared. That means you only have two more to go!

From here you'll go to **Ice Cream** and then **A** to do the same thing. Just be careful of the **Blistering Ogres** along the way. They'll usually be on the same bridges as the **Accursed Knights** and can be very annoying. If you want to be cheeky though, you can use the relic sword's block ability to reflect its blasts back at it. Very fun.

—

Once all three seals are broken, one of the buildings in the area will have a beacon of green light above it. Head to this building to get some sweet loot and move forward.

On the way to the next encounter you'll find another cavern with a series of doors. I'm not gonna tell you which entrance to go in as it's honestly funnier to figure it out on your own. Sorry.
