## Notes

### Team Setup

If you want to be organized, here's how I'd set things up:
- Two guardians to stand underneath the totem and add clear
- One guardian to take the **Void Charges** from the knights and deposit them.

### Details

The layout of the room is pretty easy to get used to, but one of the biggest points I'd pay attention to are the ledges above the rally flag as boomer knights will spawn there and ruin your day.

Also definitely keep an eye out on the **Annihilator Totem** and the **Encroaching Darkness** debuff.

### Loadouts

Pure add clear and survivability. Maybe something longer range to deal with the boomer knights up top.

## Survive

So we're gonna start things off with a nice little callout:

> [!careful] Don't Go Too Far In!  
> When entering from the tunnels, don't immediately start the encounter. Stick close to the wall and make your way to the centermost stand where you'll see a rally flag. If you immediately start the encounter, the ogres from the previous area *will not despawn* and will make your life miserable.

Now that that's out of the way, let's start.

To actually start the encounter, shoot the Hive who look like their praying to the **Annihilator Totem** in the back by the barrier and seals.

Underneath this totem is where you're going to live for this encounter.

Honestly, things are pretty straightforward here. By the totem are six seals and a dunk point. Using our powers of deduction here, we can tell that we need to deposit six **Void Charges** in order to continue on.

You're going to end up killing a ton of adds and waiting for those fun **Heretical Knights** to spawn in. When they do, kill them, take the charge, dunk it, and repeat.

*However...*

> [!deadly] Why is it Glowing?!  
> The two biggest mechanical causes of wipes here involve the **Annihilator Totem** and the debuff **Encroaching Darkness**. If no one is on the totem, it will eventually begin to glow orange / red and continue to do so until it pops and everyone dies. If you've done Crota's End you'll know this mechanic very well.

> In the same vein, watch out for the stacks of that debuff as when it reaches x10, that will also be a wipe. Depositing the charge is what resets that debuff.

All in all, things are pretty straightforward here. Deposit a total of six **Void Charges** and move forward to one of the most frustrating maxes.
