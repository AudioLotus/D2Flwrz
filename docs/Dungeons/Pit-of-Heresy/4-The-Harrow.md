## Notes

### Team Setup

I feel like I could copy and paste this line in every dungeon encounter, but there's really not much to do here role wise. Everyone can do their own thing or move as a group.

### Details

Dear God watch out for the traps. It might be best to use a map here to navigate around, but plan on getting lost and turned around a ton.

### Loadouts

Add clear and a decent special / exotic primary to take out some Wizards.

## Hide and Seek

Everything here is pretty straightforward honestly. When you first drop in, you'll see three Hive runes on a wall in front of you. These correspond to specific towers around the map where a Wizard resides. I think it goes without saying that you need to go pay them a visit and give them a nice hug.

Y'know, as you do.

There are a couple of ways to locate these wonderful beings:

=== "The Easy Way"

    Use a map to locate each specific tower so you don't get as lost.

=== "The ~~fun~~ Hard Way"

    Wander around only using your radar to find out where the Wizards reside.

Pretty straightforward yeah? Here's the map in case you want to use it.

The [original Reddit post](https://redd.it/dpkc4c) this came from has been since deleted, but I thought I'd link it here anyway for posterity's sake.

> If everyone dies, it's a complete wipe and you have to start the entire encounter over with new symbols to find each time. Also when anyone dies, there's a 45 second respawn timer which can get annoying.

Thankfully once all the seals are broken, the encounter is technically over and you won't have to wipe if something happens. The respawn timer also gets set to only five seconds or so.

Anyway that's it really.

Now onto the boss!
