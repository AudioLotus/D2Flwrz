## Notes

### Team Setup

Does it need much repeating here? Everyone can work together or separate really.

### Details

Pay attention to each of the towers in the arena. Each one houses a specific Disciple (the main enemies from the first encounter). Looking at the arena, from left to right, they contain the**Knight**, **Shrieker**, and **Wizard** respectively.

Keep an eye out on the pedestals around. These spawn adds.

### Loadouts

A metric fuck ton of add clear and some form of close range, high damage heavy and/or super. Wells, in my opinion, aren't really super necessary here unless you just really want one.

## Swarms and Flames

Like most of the dungeon here, things are fairly straightforward. The encounter starts by getting too close to the center or shooting things.

Your first order of action is to kill one of the **Accursed Swordbearers** and take the relic sword they drop.  

Then, you'll go to into each of the towers mentioned above and play rock-paper-scissors to kill the resident Disciple. When they die, they'll drop a **Void Charge**, which you need to dunk in one of the three points around. They're fairly easy to spot as they're placed in front of each tower.

If for some reason you lose one, no sweat. When all Disciples are killed, orbs will spawn in each tower. This is honestly pretty nice as you don't have to wait for them to respawn or something.

Once all three charges are dunked, dps will begin.

**In order to actually damage Zulmak, you need to be in the inner ring by the crystal in the center.**

Basically getting right up in his face is the key.

> There are two major things that can ruin your day here and cause a wipe:
> - After a few moments of dps, a bunch of cursed thrall are going to start asking for hugs. It's easy to get focused on Zulmak and not see them sneak up on you.
> - Dps is also time gated. When you see him plunge his sword in the ground and flames start to rise, get the hell out because you will die in mere moments.

Honestly I wish Bungie would scale older dungeons and raids with the current power levels as the current power creep basically allows you to one-phase him here.

If something happens and you can't, no judgement from me. You'll just have to kill the freshly respawned Disciples and dunk more charges again.

Good job on clearing the dungeon! Proud of you.
