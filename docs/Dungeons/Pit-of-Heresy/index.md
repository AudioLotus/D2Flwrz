## Mechanics

So thankfully this dungeon is pretty consistent with its mechanics and they're fairly easy to navigate.

###### Callouts

You'll find with most Hive related encounters over the different seasons and DLC that there are various runes. As is tradition, each team has different callouts for them. Here are the ones I use:

In my experience with Pit, you won't be verbally calling these out a lot. However, they're still nice to know in case they need communicated.

Most times you'll see these emblems as seals in chains that need to be broken to move forward.

###### Dunking

There will be a number of times where you have to dunk a **Void Charge** into small Hive containers. Dunking these will break the seals mentioned above so the fireteam can progress through the dungeon.

###### Rock-Paper-Scissors

Listen, I get y'all are probably going to yell at me for the order I put those in, but I'm not going to change my ways. This is an important aspect in the first and final encounters where you need to defeat specific enemies using a relic sword dropped by **Accursed Knights**  in different ways:

=== "Knight"  
	Use the light attack of the sword to murderize it.

=== "Wizard"  
	Use the heavy attack to shoot waves of energy at it.

=== "Shrieker"  
	Use the guard to reflect its blasts back at it. Fun fact, you can also reflect the blasts from ogres with this.
