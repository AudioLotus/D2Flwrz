## Mechanics  
  
DSC builds upon a few mechanics throughout the raid. These are primarily through color coded augments (roles) you can pick up through terminals.  
  
They are:  
<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- ![Operator Augment](../../assets/img/DSC-Operator.png){ width="90" text-align="center" }
**Operator**  
Shoots things like panels  
  
- ![Scanner Augment](../../assets/img/DSC-Scanner.png){ width="90" text-align="center" }  
**Scanner**  
Looks for glowing points of interest  
  
- ![Suppressor Augment](../../assets/img/DSC-Suppressor.png){ width="90" text-align="center" }  
**Suppressor**  
Stands under drones and shoots a boss or two  
</div>
  
These are dropped by vandal hackers that will appear with the symbol of the augment appearing over their head. Guardians will also have these symbols above them when picked up.  
  
Augments are swapped between various terminals throughout each encounter, there are typically three within reach at any time.
