Raids in Destiny are honestly a ton of fun. There's lots of puzzles, fun mechanics, and great challenges. Although they can be a little overwhelming to learn at first, they're very rewarding both in game and out.

The team dynamic is slightly different as planning around each other's classes and abilities is more important here than other game modes. Communication is 100% important here as well as there are often a lot of moving parts.
  
Here are the guides I have thus far:
