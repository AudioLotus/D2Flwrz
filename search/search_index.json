For certain encounters, different types of weapons might be necessary like in situations where a boss can\u2019t be hit by a sword or where a sniper won\u2019t be good because the boss will be five feet in front of you.

An old but familiar location from Shadowkeep. This time we\u2019re heading straight for the back of the room where there\u2019s a crystal and a Hive barrier blocking a hole that will open up momentarily.</p> <p>When your fireteam drops down, you\u2019ll navigate through some creepy dark tunnels until you find yourselves by a rally point and a vast cavern with a Hive city built into it.</p> <p>The first thing to do is locate the building with the A symbol above it and peak inside the door. It\u2019ll be towards the right from the rally banner, down from the ledge. There\u2019s going to be an Accursed Swordbearer there just hanging out and minding his business. Murderize him and take his sword.</p> <p>Above where is now corpse is, you\u2019ll notice three seals bound in chains. Breaking these is the main goal here.</p> <p>How do we do that? Well you just have to match the symbols found here to the buildings throughout the cavern.</p> <p>For example, if you have Burger , Ice Cream , and A , you\u2019ll locate the buildings with those symbols above them.</p> Matching Ice Cream Seals <p>It doesn\u2019t really matter which order you do these in, but let\u2019s just start from the first building in our example, Burger.</p> <p>When you get to Burger, you\u2019ll notice that the entrance is walled off by a Hive barrier. Damn. Opening the door is easy though, just kill the Pit Keeper nearby and bam, it\u2019s open.</p> <p>Inside you\u2019ll find either a Knight , Wizard , or Shrieker. Each one of them can only be killed by the relic sword in a specific manner. I mentioned what to do in the intro, but I\u2019ll repeat it here for ease of access:</p> Knight (Might of the Broken Blade)Wizard (Omen of the Broken Blade)Shrieker (Oracle of the Broken Blade) <p>Use the light attack of the sword to murderize it.</p> <p>Use the heavy attack to shoot waves of energy at it.</p> <p>Use the guard to reflect its blasts back at it. Fun fact, you can also reflect the blasts from ogres with this.</p> <p>What Do You Mean Immune?!</p> <p>It bears reiterating that the only way to kill these particular enemies is to use the relic sword dropped by an Accursed Swordbearer. Any other weapon or ability will not do a damn thing.</p> <p>The relic sword has a limited number of uses as well. Pay attention to the ammo! If you need another sword, go to one of the bridges close by and wait for another Accursed Swordbearer to spawn. If you don\u2019t feel like waiting, you can typically find one in a building with a symbol that doesn\u2019t match one of the ones you need.</p> <p>Fantastic! It\u2019s dead! Huzzah! After you kill it, notice that one of the three seals has disappeared. That means you only have two more to go!</p> <p>From here you\u2019ll go to Ice Cream and then A to do the same thing. Just be careful of the Blistered Ogres along the way. They\u2019ll usually be on the same bridges as the Accursed Swordbearers and can be very annoying. If you want to be cheeky though, you can use the relic sword\u2019s block ability to reflect its blasts back at it. Very fun.</p> <p>\u2014</p> <p>Once all three seals are broken, one of the buildings in the area will have a beacon of green light above it. Head to this building to get some sweet loot and move forward.</p> Beam of light showing the exit. <p>On the way to the next encounter you\u2019ll find another cavern with a series of doors.
